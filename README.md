 # Learnt things from this Project :
 
1) Learned how to create a new visualization (Calendar visualization) using matrix tables which can be used for various analytical purposes.
2) Looking at different cancellation policies of different products, I found that most of the Brands do not charge any fee for the cancellation of the products.
